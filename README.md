# 📚 EpicBook Application Deployment on Microsoft Azure

## 📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment of a **Node.js (Express.js) Book Store application** on **Microsoft Azure** using a Virtual Machine, Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server, and Nginx Reverse Proxy.

The project follows a three-tier architecture where the application is deployed on an Azure Ubuntu Virtual Machine and connected securely to an Azure MySQL Flexible Server using private networking.

This project showcases real-world cloud deployment practices including Linux administration, Azure networking, database integration, and reverse proxy configuration.
